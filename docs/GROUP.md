# Assingment 1 Machine Learning
## Group 4: Sten Oskar Halse & Mats Bakketeig
### Group work:
When solving the assignment, we used pair programming to collaborate effectively.
Since we worked in a Jupyter Notebook environment, we found it easier to work on a single 
machine, allowing us to focus on the code together without needing to switch. 
We did this to avoid potential merge conflicts.

The group work went smoothly overall. We held discussions about the best approaches to 
different aspects of the assignment and were able to brainstorm various methods before 
implementation. This collaborative workflow helped us plan ahead and structure our work 
efficiently.

While completing the assignment took several hours, the learning experience were great,
and the pair programming approach enabled us to work together good and improve the quality of our work.
We both also gained a better understanding from each other after sharing different insights

### Feature engineering
We discussed if we should implement more feature engineering, by adding new attributes from the existing attributes.
After discussing this, we chose to not implement it because the sheer number of attributes in the dataset already big.
